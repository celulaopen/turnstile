Turnstile is a simple authorization module.
With turnstile you'll be able to define rules for each role to access  your controllers and views.

= Roles, Rules and Privileges

You can define all roles, all rules and all privileges in the config file, placed in _config/initializers/turnstile.rb_

= Privileges


  privilege :read do
     allows_to :show, :index
     denies_to :destroy, :create
  end

  privilege :manage do
    allows_to :create, :new
    allows_to :destroy
  end


= Rules to Roles


Below we have an example:

  role :reader do
    can :read => :posts
    can :read => :comments
  end
    
  role :admin do
    inherits :reader
    can :manage => :posts
  end


= The Default Role


You need to set a role to be used when the current user has no role

  default :reader


An example of config file can be found in config/initializers/turnstile.rb in this repo.

= The user model

 To set the model, so far it is hardcoded, so you need a column call **:user_role** (String) in
 your user model, and be sure to have a method that returns the current user, called _current_user_.
 
= Controllers
For each controller that you want to monirate just call:

  before_filer :verify_role_permissions!
